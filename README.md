# Diabetic-Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a serious eye condition that affects people with diabetes. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Diabetes can lead to high blood sugar levels, which can damage the blood vessels throughout the body, including those in the retina. 
Diabetic retinopathy often affects both eyes and typically does not cause noticeable symptoms in the early stages. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include blurred or distorted vision, floaters (spots or dark strings in the visual field), impaired color vision, and even total vision loss if left untreated.
